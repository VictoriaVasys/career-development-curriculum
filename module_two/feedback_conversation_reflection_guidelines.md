# Feedback II Reflection

* Date of feedback conversation: March 22, 2017

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 
I prepared by reflecting in my notebook on all of the things we had accomplished as a group & thought about things that could be improved. I made lists for each of my team members and also tried to think about ways in which I could improve or some instances of when I wasn't at my best and came up with asks for feedback accordingly.

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 
The conversation was excellent. I wasn't sure how I was doing as a project manager and getting feedback on that was really reassuring and motivating to continue to take on the extra work. I hadn't worked with any of my group members prior, so I wasn't sure that we were all on the same page & happy with each others' progress but we all had really positive things to say and that helped team cohesion from there on out. Speaking about my feelings of others is not easy, but in general, the conversation went really well. I imagine if we had more tension in our group or someone who wasn't contributing as much as others, it would have been difficult to address the conflict while not making anyone feel defensive and brainstorming solutions together would also be a challenge.

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
I used actionable, specific and kind language and various forms of appreciation and evaluation regarding individuals and our group as a whole. I tried to have a brief opening, a meaty and specific body and a positive, actionable closing to my part of the conversation. I also tried my best to be engaged and present and not interrupt when someone was giving me feedback. Writing things down ahead of time really helped me to organize my thoughts and be clear and concise in my feedback.
